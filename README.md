## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/newsfactchecker-frontend.git
cd newsfactchecker-frontend
```
2. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Run the Application

🔐 Authentication
```
JWT Token is generated by backend and stored in localStorage.

Based on role (admin or user), users are redirected to appropriate dashboards.

Auth token is attached to every protected backend request via an HTTP interceptor (if implemented).
```
🔗 API Endpoints (via Spring Boot backend)
Make sure your backend is running locally or hosted (e.g., Railway):
```
bash
Copy
Edit
POST   /authenticate         → Login user & generate token
GET    /fact-check?query=    → Fetch fact-check result from Google API
GET    /admin/users          → Admin fetches all registered users
DELETE /admin/delete/:username → Admin deletes a user
```
Note: Replace API URLs in environment.ts with your backend deployment link.
